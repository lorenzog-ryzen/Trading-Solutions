Introduction
This project aims to enhance trading efficiency by combining Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with algorithmic trading. The project was developed as part of a study at Universidad del Norte, with contributions from Lorenzo David Gutierrez Vesga and Juan Esteban Albis.

Project Structure
The project is structured into two main parts:

Backtesting Module: Implements various trading strategies and evaluates their performance using historical data.
Q-Learning Implementation: Integrates Q-Learning techniques to optimize trading strategies.
Backtesting Module
The backtesting module is designed to test different trading strategies using historical data. The module calculates various performance metrics, including the profit factor.

Strategies
Mean Proximity Strategy
Description: This strategy focuses on the mean proximity of asset prices.
Performance: Achieved a profit factor of 14.77.
Von Neumann Strategy
Description: A strategy inspired by the Von Neumann model.
Performance: Achieved a profit factor of 0.18.
Q-Learning Implementation
The Q-Learning implementation aims to improve trading decisions by learning from historical data. The performance of the Q-Learning strategy was evaluated with a profit factor of 0.28.

Results
The backtesting results show varying performance across different strategies. The Mean Proximity Strategy outperformed other strategies with a high-profit factor, while the Q-Learning implementation showed promise with a moderate profit factor.

Conclusions and Future Work
The integration of DQN with algorithmic trading presents a versatile approach to developing efficient trading strategies. Future work will focus on refining the Q-Learning models and exploring additional strategies to enhance performance.
